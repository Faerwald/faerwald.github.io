    <h1>Jason is working on ".F.A.E.R.W.A.L.D"</h1>
    <p>Faerwald Tech was born out of a desire to safeguard what matters most, and a deeply personal quest to protect loved ones from unforeseen harm and disease. I am primarily self-funded through fortunate investments in various stocks and cryptocurrencies. I am not afraid to explore what most would consider impossible or nonsensical. I am currently dedicated to the development of vector potential communication and vacuum state cybernetics - the key breakthrough science enabling reverse causation, hypercomputation, and inter-timeline teleportation. I am wholeheartedly committed to developing technology (Sep/Dec 2023) that can peer into the future and alter the past, opening the door to a world where history can be rewritten as easily as editing a manuscript. The power to turn dreams into reality, and nightmares into magic is part of what I truly stand for. Time travel isn't cheating, it is inevitable. -Jason Agamenon Sokaris
