    <h1>Jason Sokaris</h1>
    <p>I'm developing vector potential communication and precognitive AI, technology capable of foreseeing the unforeseeable and preventing the unacceptable events that transcend traditional foresight. I dream of machines that can rewrite history as easily as editing a manuscript, protect loved ones from harm and cure disease in unprecedented ways, and ensure that the future has a future, always.</p>
